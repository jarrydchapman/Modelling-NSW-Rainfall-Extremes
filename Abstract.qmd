## Abstract {.unnumbered}

Extreme rainfall events can cause considerable social and economic costs to the impacted communities. These costs are heightened when extremes cluster together in time, potentially resulting in natural disasters such as floods. The Hawkesbury River region was subject to five flooding events between 2020 and 2022 during a rare 'triple dip' La Ni√±a. This paper proposes a set of Non-Homogeneous Poisson Processes to model the arrival and temporal clustering of extremes in the Hawkesbury region, finding that evidence of clustering exists and that additional climatological covariates provide explanatory power informing the extreme arrival process. The research has applications for risk and disaster management, with hopes to inform and mitigate flood risk in the region.
